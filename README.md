# 👋 Hi, I’m Drashti Shah

Welcome to my GitHub profile!  
This account is my learning space where I’m starting my journey into **cloud computing and modern tech skills** 🚀

I’m brand new to GitHub, and this profile will grow as I learn by **building real projects**, not just watching tutorials.

---

## 🌱 What I’m Currently Learning

I’m actively learning and practicing:

- ☁️ **AWS Cloud Fundamentals**
- 🧱 **Cloud Architecture (VPC, EC2, IAM, S3, RDS)**
- ⚙️ **Hands-on Projects & Labs**
- 📄 **Git & GitHub basics**
- 🔐 **Security best practices (IAM, networking basics)**

All projects here are built step-by-step with explanations so I truly understand *why* things work, not just *how*.

## 🤝 How This GitHub Is Being Used

This GitHub is part of a **guided learning collaboration** where I am:

- Learning AWS and cloud concepts from scratch
- Working on **real-world style projects**
- Understanding how professionals structure repositories
- Practicing documentation, version control, and clean workflows

The goal is **skill-building**, confidence, and hands-on experience.

## 🛠️ Projects (In Progress)

You’ll start seeing repositories here such as:

- 🔹 AWS VPC & Networking Labs  
- 🔹 EC2 & IAM Hands-on Projects

Each project will include:
- Clear explanations

## 🎯 Why I’m Doing This

I believe the best way to learn tech is by:
- Building things
- Breaking things
- Fixing them
- Documenting everything

This GitHub is proof of **learning in progress**, not perfection.
